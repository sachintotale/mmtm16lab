== Introduction

Welcome to the lab session on the LEAP platform APIs.
  We'll touch upon the functionality of the application we're going to tweak and highlight the technology used.

=== Application
The application we have with us deals with a loan application use case. Loan applicants can upload a loan document
entering details about the loan and send it for approval. A loan officer can then log into the system and review the
loan created and choose to approve the document providing comments for the same. Once the document is approved it is
then read-only meaning the users cannot edit the document thereon.

Users log into the system using the log in button.

Once logged in, the user sees his profile page.
This profile page displays the user's information including the roles he has in the system.

The 'Documents' option in the side navigation panel allows the user to navigate to the main functionality panel.
The user is provided with options to view loan documents in the system (Loans) or browse the repository (Home)

The user can click on the 'Home' option to display folders in the system under the root directory of the system
A user with the role of 'loan applicant' (Bob and Sue) can then right-click on a listed folder to see options to 'Create Loan Content'

The user is then provided a dialog to import a loan document (blob service)
and provide required loan content info (a trait in the system that is attached to the loan content file)

Once a user with the role of a 'loan officer' (Joe) logs into the application
and navigates to 'Documents' using the navigation panel,
the user is presented with the loans created by other loan applicants.
Context menu options are provided to 'Edit' (review) the loan application.
Once approved by the loan officer (loan review status trait applied and related info provided)
the loan is applied made read-only by the system (a permission set is applied on the loan).

=== Virtual Machine

The Virtual that we host will contain all necessary to buid the application

This includes the following:

* LEAP CMS running
** Can be run by executing the run.bat file located at C:\mmtm\cms_informed_2
* The web application that will be the base for the lab session consisting of the following technologies
** Node.js
** npm
** webpack
** AngularJs
* Sublime and Brackets editors
* This documentation
* POSTMAN REST Api client
* Chrome browser


=== Application structure

The web application built is an AngularJS 1.x application using ES6 constructs.
Babel is used to transpile and webpack is used to bundle.

==== Angular specific conventions followed

Application organisation rules:

1. Split app into angular "modules"
 * every module has its own folder, and is defined in one file which will require all module components and will export module name
3. Every file should have only one entity inside it, for example if there is directive which has controller and template - there should be three files, plus likely two for unit tests
4. Grouped related resources by folders
5. Named files with suffixes `.directive`, `.controller`, `.component`, `.factory`, `.service`, `.provider`, etc.

=== Running the application
The application can be run by executing the following commands

1. Run CMS
 * executing the run.bat file located at C:\mmtm\cms_informed_2
2. Run web application
 * Execute the following command at the console from the location C:\mmtm\mmtm-client
 to run the build and watch for changes
 ** npm run build
 * Execute the following command at the console from the location C:\mmtm\mmtm-client
 to run the nodejs server that hosts the application (and also reload when changes occur - nodemon)
 ** nodemon app.js

=== Approach to session assigments
Since this is a lab session to showcase the LEAP APIs, the views are ready for you. The assignments are geared towards
implementing the service layer from the controllers. In case you have not been able to complete a particular round of
coding you can catch up with the alternate implementations that are provided in the *.service.ex.js files.
