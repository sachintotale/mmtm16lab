This is the top level folder which is created by default in the system.

      "href": "http://localhost:8080/folders?filter=parentFolder%20is%20null&page=3&items-per-page=10"
    }
  }
}

=== View
In the application, this folder resource is fetched when the logged in user navigates to the 'Documents' View

Once fetched, the presence of the folder resource is used to activate the 'Go' button in the card for 'Home'
(`ng-disabled="!vm.rootFolder"`)

`src/modules/content/content.html`
[source,html]
<md-button ng-disabled="!vm.rootFolder" ng-click="vm.showHomeFolder()">Go</md-button>

=== Controller
`src/modules/content/content.controller.js` +
In the content controller we load the folder resource in the following manner

[source,javascript]
  constructor($window, FolderService, ContentService, ...) {
    ...
    this.folderService.fetchRootFolder().then( (items) => {
      if (Array.isArray(items) && items.length == 1) {
        this.rootFolder = items[0];
      }
    })

=== Service
==== Assignment:
The following function is to fetch and return the result of the data fetch operation to retrieve the root folder.
Right now it returns empty.
Details of the required implementation are in the function comments as seen below

Location: `src/services/folder.service.js`
[source,javascript]
    /**
     * TODO Assignment: Implement this method
     * Get the folder resource which has no parentFolder - parentFolder is null
     *     using a filter when requesting for folders in the system
     *
     * Use the /folders REST api and apply a filter by parentFolder is null
     *      ?filter=parentFolder is null
     * Return the response item list - data._embedded.itemResourceList - as the result promised
     * @returns {*|Promise.<TResult>}
     */
    fetchRootFolder() {
        return this.$q.resolve([]);
    }
