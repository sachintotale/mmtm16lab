== Assignment 8

Fetch an object's permission resource using the acl property on the object resource

In this assignment we perform the REST request for getting a permission resource by id.
This can be used in conjunction with the user's roles to decide if the user has a particular permit on the object. +
For example, the acl can be used along with user roles from the user token to decide if the user has
'write' permits on an object and then disable UI based on it.

=== API 
==== Request
[source,http]
GET /permissions/id HTTP/1.1
HOST: localhost:8080
authorization: bearer eyJh...
content-type: application/json

==== Response
[source,json]
{
    "name": "loanApproved",
    "description": "Loan Approved",
    "owner": "app_admin",
    "roles": [{
        "name": "loan_officer",
        "permits": ["change_location", "browse", "annotate", "comment", "print", "read"]
    }, {
        "name": "loan_applicant",
        "permits": ["read", "browse"]
    }],
    "users": [],
    "tenantId": "acme",
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://localhost:8080/permissions/idhere"
        }
    },
    "id": "idhere",
    "eTag": 0
}

=== Controller
`src/modules/contentEdit/contentEdit.controller.js` +
In the contentEdit controller we decide if the user has edit permit on the resource in the following manner

[source,javascript]
  //retrieve acl for the current document
  ObjectService.fetchObjectPermissionInfo(this.content).then(permission => {
    this.documentAcl = permission;
    var applicableDocRoles = this.documentAcl.roles.filter(role => {
      return this.userRoles.includes(role.name);
    });
    var permitFound = applicableDocRoles.find(role => {
      return role.permits && role.permits.includes('write')
    });
    if (permitFound) {
      this.userCanEditDocument = true;
    }
  });


=== Service
==== Assignment:
The following function is to be used to get a permission resource by id and return the response item. Right now it returns empty.
Details of the required implementation are in the function comments

Location: `src/services/object.service.js`
[source,javascript]
/**
 * TODO Assignment
 * For the given REST resource get the value of the acl property - this is an acl id.
 * Get the corresponding permission REST resource for this acl
 *
 * Use the /permissions/:id REST api to get the permission resource for the acl property on the object
 * Return the same as response data promised
 * @param object
 * @returns {*|Promise.<TResult>}
 */
fetchObjectPermissionInfo(object: Object) {
    return this.$q.resolve({});
}
